# alu.bz

A short URL service that uses the Ethereum blockchain for access control.

This is a proof of concept to demonstrate the minimum amount of code required to
use Ethereum for this purpose.

Supersedes [alu.pm](https://github.com/ardislu/alu.pm).

## Testing locally

To run the frontend and the backend at the same time:
